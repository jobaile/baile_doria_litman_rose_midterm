# Ontario Summer
The Challenge:
Ontario Summer is committed to increasing annual non-resident visitation to Ontario during the short 75-day tourism season from June to August. The goal is to create a campaign that will educate potential visitors as to how they can find themselves at home in Ontario throughout the beautiful summer months.

The Campaign:
In order to reach the set goals and attract non-residents to visit Ontario, it is necessary to develop a strong brand and enticing web and marketing campaign that positions Ontario as the ultimate summer travel destination. This campaign will feature graphically driven content, which focuses on the natural beauty, adventure and peaceful retreat that Ontario offers.
